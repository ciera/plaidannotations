= How to add a new annotation =
  # Checkout all three projects: PlaidAnnotations, PlaidFeature, and PlaidAnnotationsUpdateSite
  # Add the annotation in the appropriate package. Make a new package for your project if one isn't already there.
  # Create the jar file. In PlaidAnnotations:
    # Export to jar file
    # Include the source of all annotations. Not the src directory though.
  # In PlaidAnnotations/plugin.xml, do the following:
    # Increment the version number.
    # If you have added a new package, add it to the list of exported packages
    # If you have added a new source directory, select it in the "binary build"
  # In PlaidAnnotationsFeature/feature.xml, increment the version number to match
  # In PlaidAnnotationsUpdateSite/site.xml
   # Select the existing feature (under Annotations), right click, and remove it.
   #Select "Annotations, click "Add Feature.." and add the one with the new version number.
   # Click "Build All".
  # Commit, update from the update site, and make sure it worked!

And if you screw up, you MUST increment the version number again!
